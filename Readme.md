## Add Own Patterns

There are 4 patterns (gestures) created in current project, but can add your own. As many as you wish!

To add your own pattern, edit `Utils.swift` the next way:

Add `x` and `y` arrays of your pattern. In these arrays nodes of a pattern are encoded.

```Swift
let gn_x : [CGFloat] = [1, 0.5, 0.5, 0]
let gn_y : [CGFloat] = [0, 1, 0, 1]
```

Add the constant for your gesture ro enum `Gestures`:

```Swift
case g1
```

Add your patter to `compare` and `compareWith` functions.

Add your pattern to `movementHandler` function.

DONE.
