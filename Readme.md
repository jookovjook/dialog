If you don't have an API key, you can get one at [Yandex SpeeckKit](https://tech.yandex.ru/speechkit/).

`Build` project and `Run` it.

## Overview

### Cards

â€¢ Use cards on the main screen to quickly synthesize text

You can create your own card by pressing `+` on the main screen and edit already existing cards.

### Dialog

Type text using keyboard to enable other people see what you want to say them.

Type `Microphone` button at the top of the screen to start speech-to text recognition. Recongised speech will be quickly displayed at the screen.
